# Secret Society
We all were young kids who went to school, college or university. In addition, we've been always interested in secret societies. We always hear about them on the news, on the radio and the Internet. Some of us had the chance to be part of secret societies when they went to university. Interest in this has always been, is and will be. Our task is to allow everyone to feel what it means to be an organizer or a part of secret society for her own benefit or the benefit of her small community (school, town, city, state, country).
