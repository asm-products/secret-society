# Secret Society
_Create your own secret society in seconds!_

You'll need a few things before you can run this locally:

1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)<br />
2. [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) **[unimplemented for now]**

Once you have these installed then open up your console and navigate to the directory that you've cloned this repository to. Run `npm install` to get all of required dependencies and then run `node index` to start the server.

Congrats, you're up and running! Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser and give it a whirl!
